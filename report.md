### 6. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
  
Here we want to run test in Lab7, therefore we need to `cd` in to Lab7; `cd Lab7`
  
When we where in Lab7 we want to see what is in this file, so we use `ls` to print out all files in Lab7

We see that we have a `test.sh`, which is a bash for testing. 
Then we run this bash by `bash test.sh`
  
Which it the testes fail.
